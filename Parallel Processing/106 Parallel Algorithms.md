• Algorithm: A step-by-step method to solve a complete problem.  
	• Example: Sorting a list, multiplying matrices, or finding the shortest path.  
• **Parallel Algorithm**: An algorithm designed to run multiple steps at the same  
time on different parts of the data.  
	• This helps solve big problems faster by using multiple processors or cores.  
• Parallel Pattern: A common piece of code that shows up in lots of programs.  
	• It does part of a job, but not the whole solution by itself. Think of it like a  
	"tool" used inside a bigger algorithm.
