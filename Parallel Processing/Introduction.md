# Parallel Processing

Objective: design and implement multi-threaded and multi-processed applications. 
We will use C++, CMake and Catch2, OOP, with a focus on shared memory limitations. 
Not using all of C++, only the components and libraries relevant to parallel processing, in order to make the most efficient use of resources. 
- C++ 
- CMake and Catch 2
	- Used for providing us structure for writing and deploying applications. 
	- Makes things significantly easier. 
- Object Oriented Programming
	- Not typically for parallel processing, but libraries still use them to build upon baseline C++. The basic program structure is all C++.

 **Introduction to Parallel Computing**
 We will begin by writing C++ programs and then planning how to make them parallel by observing the most expensive parts of the programs and balancing how they operate together.
