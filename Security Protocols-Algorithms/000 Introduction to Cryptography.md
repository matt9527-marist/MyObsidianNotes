## What is Cryptography
**Art and science of encryption**
Can also be defined as the process of converting human readable information into cyphertext specifically for the goal of preventing unauthorized access. 
The main goals surrounding cybersecurity are centered on access. We do not want unauthorized agents to be able to read or write to private data. 

**Role of Cryptography**
This is not the only thing we need to be focused on. The security of our systems are dependent on strongest vs. weakest link.
1. Cryptography is useless without security mechanisms that go along with it.
	- Cryptography can be deployed within a larger ecosystem, not just by itself.
	- Many organizations implement cryptography, but fail in incorporating other security strategies with it. 
2. Access Management
3. Why is the major focus on it?
	- From an app development standpoint, it is one of the most important aspects as one of the most natural points of access for an attacker. 
	- If an attacker gets around encryption, the risk is very high, as it is extremely easy to impersonate actors when in possession of their encryption keys. 

**Threat Models**
*A security system is only as strong as its weakest link.*
