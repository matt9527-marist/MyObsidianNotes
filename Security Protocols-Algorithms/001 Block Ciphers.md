## Block Ciphers and Block Cipher Modes
**What is a block cipher?**


**Monoalphabetic Cipher**
An algorithm that only uses one set of substitution or transposition. This is mapping one letter in the plaintext to exactly one letter in the ciphertext. Examples:
1. One of the first methods was tattooing or stensiling a message into a person's head. 
2. 1900 BC the first encrypted messages
3. 100-44 BC The Caesar Cipher is the first monoalphabetic cipher.

Usually we have a code, in this case, simply +5, where that is the amount to which we shift the cipher. In the above image, this would be +3, because A -> D, 3 forwards in the alphabet. Note that this cipher loops. 
*Transposition Cipher* - Using all of the same characters, scrambling the message.
