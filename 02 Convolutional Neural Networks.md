We have started with standard MLPs:

A neural network can function alright with providing a classification for a centralized input image. The way that this works, the MLP takes the input row by row of pixels. 
- When the input is NOT centralized, the input will be of a completely different shape that is not recognized. 

**Translation Invariance provide by CNN**

CNNs use a sliding window to search for elements (pixels) within an image to find a given pattern.
