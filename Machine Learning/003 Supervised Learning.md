The advertising budgets are  
input variables while sales  
input is an output variable.  
✓ Sales= f(Radio, TV ads )

We assume that there is some relationship between the output variable 𝑦 and the input variables denotes as a vector 𝐱 = (𝑥<sub>1</sub>, 𝑥<sub>2</sub>, . . , 𝑥<sub>𝑚</sub> which can be written in the very general form.
