We can interpret the variables as positions on coordinate axes.\nA function that accepts a vector as input and returns a single number as output is known as a scalar field. – For example, temperature (we can measure the temperature at any point in a room given three spatial coordinates)\nAlso a function that accepts a vector as  input and returns a vector as output is know as a vector field .– A gradient can be nicely depicted a a vector field \n\n*The gradient tells us how much a function of more than one variable is changing and the direction in which it is changing the most*. The gradient is the derivative of a function which accepts a *vector* as its input.\n\nGiven a multi-input function: $$f(\\vec{x}) = f(x_{1},x_{2}, x_{3}\\dots, x_{m})$$\n$$\\nabla f(\\vec{x}) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{ \\partial {\\vec{x}} }{ \\partial x_{1} } \\\\\n\\frac{ \\partial {\\vec{x}} }{ \\partial x_{2} } \\\\ \\\\\n\\dots \\\\\n\\frac{ \\partial {\\vec{x}} }{ \\partial x_{m} }   \n\\end{bmatrix}$$\nThe gradient packes all partial derivative information of `f` into a vector.
