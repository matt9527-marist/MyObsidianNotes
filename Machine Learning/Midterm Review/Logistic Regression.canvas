We are doing *classification* here, but just using a different architecture. \n\nRecall:\nLinear regression essentially tries to fit a straight line (or hyperplane) to predict a continuous target. \nwhere: $$y = w_{0} + w_{1}x_{1} + w_{2}x_{2} + \\dots$$\nor the target output predicted as: $$y = w^Tx + b$$\nWe cannot use this for classification because we need it to output probabilities not just the main predicted target. \n"}
