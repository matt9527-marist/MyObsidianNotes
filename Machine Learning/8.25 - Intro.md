## What is Machine Learning?

**Field of study giving computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed**
- Detecting patterns and regularities with a good and generalizable approximation("model" or "hypothesis")
- Execution of a computer program to optimize the parameters of the model using training data or past experience.

Modern AI is mostly data-driven. 
Most of machine learning can be simplified to a optimization problem, often using a dataset to predict something in the future. We want that prediction to be as accurate as possible.
