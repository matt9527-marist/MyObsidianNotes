## What is Machine Learning?

**Field of study giving computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed**
- Detecting patterns and regularities with a good and generalizable approximation("model" or "hypothesis")
- Execution of a computer program to optimize the parameters of the model using training data or past experience.

Modern AI is mostly data-driven. 
Most of machine learning can be simplified to a optimization problem, often using a dataset to predict something in the future. We want that prediction to be as accurate as possible. 

*A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.*

Task T: recognizing and classifying handwritten word  
Performance measure P: percent of words correctly classified  
Training experience E: a dataset

**Optimziation**:
We set a goal, we feed the leanring model data, and try to reach some kind of minimal value. 
We are trying to minimize the error of the model between the ground truth about something and its predi
