## What is Machine Learning?

**Field of study giving computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed**
- Detecting patterns and regularities with a good and generalizable approximation("model" or "hypothesis")
- Execution of a computer program to optimize the parameters of the model using training data or past experience.

Modern AI is mostly data-driven. 
Most of machine learning can be simplified to a optimization problem, often using a dataset to predict something in the future. We want that prediction to be as accurate as possible. 

*A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.*

Task T: recognizing and classifying handwritten word  
Performance measure P: percent of words correctly classified  
Training experience E: a dataset

**Optimziation**:
We set a goal, we feed the leanring model data, and try to reach some kind of minimal value. 
We are trying to minimize the error of the model between the ground truth about something and its prediction. 

Examples:
✓ Control theory (minimize a  
cost function)  
✓ Economics (maximize  
expected utility)  
✓ Operations Research  
(optimize objective  
function)  
✓ Statistics (minimize loss  
function; ML borrows this)

Mostly we discuss everything surrounding supervised learning. 
**Supervised Learning** - Regressing or classifying? Making a prediction on a descript target or a numerical target? 
There are various classes of predictions. For example, we may have a medical model make a *binary* yes or no prediction on whether an observed input image of tissue mass is cancerous. 
- There is of course the issue of dimensionality reduction. How high definition of an image would the model need? We may not need every single pixel of that image to represent a feature. 
**Reinforcement Learning** - Not our focus, but is poignant. Google's Deepmind winning games against humans using reward-based decision processing to learn series of actions. 

## Supervised Learning

#SupervisedLearning
The ML system learns patterns and relationships from large amounts of data to make predictions.

Find a way to minimize the cost function, which may be a sum of all errors or a number of other possible error accumulation functions. 
Once we have a trained model with what we want, we test it with newer inputs. 
The quality of the algorithm depends on how well we are able to capture the features out of the data we already have. 

**Training example**: A row in the table  
representing the dataset. Synonymous to an  
observation, training record, training  
instance, training sample (in some contexts,  
sample refers to a collection of training  
examples)  
**Feature**: a column in the table representing  
the dataset. Synonymous to predictor,  
variable, input, attribute,  
covariate.  
**Targets**: What we want to predict.  
Synonymous to outcome, output, ground  
truth, response variable, dependent  
variable, (class) label (in classification).  
**Output / prediction**: use this to distinguish  
from targets; here, means output from the  
model.

We will make use of the popular Iris Dataset:

With these morphological elements, we are able to make predictions on the type of Iris.
