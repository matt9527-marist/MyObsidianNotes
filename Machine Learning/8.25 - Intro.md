## What is Machine Learning?

**Field of study giving computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed**
- Detecting patterns and regularities with a good and generalizable approximation("model" or "hypothesis")
- Execution of a computer program to optimize the parameters of the model using training data or past experience.

Modern AI is mostly data-driven. 
Most of machine learning can be simplified to a optimization problem, often using a dataset to predict something in the future. We want that prediction to be as accurate as possible. 

*A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.*

Task T: recognizing and classifying handwritten word  
Performance measure P: percent of words correctly classified  
Training experience E: a dataset

**Optimziation**:
We set a goal, we feed the leanring model data, and try to reach some kind of minimal value. 
We are trying to minimize the error of the model between the ground truth about something and its prediction. 

Examples:
✓ Control theory (minimize a  
cost function)  
✓ Economics (maximize  
expected utility)  
✓ Operations Research  
(optimize objective  
function)  
✓ Statistics (minimize loss  
function; ML borrows this)

Mostly we discuss everything surrounding supervised learning. 
**Supervised Learning** - Regressing or classifying? Making a prediction on a descript target or a numerical target? 
There are various classes of predictions. For example, we may have a medical model make a binary yes or no prediction on whether an observed input image of tissue mass is cancerous.
