## Classication 
Suppose we have a classifier predicting a color of RGB:
`y = f(x) + c`
`y\hat = f(x)`
(see notes)
Relevant Metrics:
- **Accuracy** = # Matches / # Observations = 3/6 = 50% accurate
- **Error Rate** = 1 - Accuracy = 3/6 = 50% wrong

- **Confusion Matrix**:
(see notes)
	- Accuracy = Summation of Main Diagonal / Sum of All Cells
