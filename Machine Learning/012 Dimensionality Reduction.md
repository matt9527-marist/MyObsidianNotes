A big issue that we typically have in machine learning is when we are dealing with datasets containing a lot of predictors. One example is gene expression, which is a problem that makes our dataset very wide in comparison to the number of observations that you can gather. 

This creates a number of issues:
- Why are we concerned about having too many dimensions?
	- Not only the number of observations that are required to come up with good estimates may not be sufficiently
	-
