## Where does knowledge come from?
4 forms of knowledge discovery:
1) Evolution
2) Experience
3) Culture
4) Computers
Each form of knowledge discovery is orders of magnitude faster than the previous, discovering orders of magnitude more knowledge. 

Most of the knowledge in the world in the future may be extracted by machines.

**How do computers discover new knowledge?**
1) Filling gaps in existing knowledge
	- We make observations and then find ways to adapt them and explain them
2) Simulating the brain
3) Simulating evolution
	- By some standards, evolution is even greater learning algorithm 
4) Systematically reduce uncertainty
	- Realize that all knowledge learned is necessarily uncertain.
5) Reason by analogy
	- Transfer situations that we know to situations we are faced with

Five Tribes of Machine Learning:

Each of these master algorithms has a mathematical proof claiming that, given enough data, the machine can learn anything. 

### Symbolists
Think of learning as being the inverse of deduction. Learning is *induction* of knowledge. *Deduction* is going from general rules to specific facts.
