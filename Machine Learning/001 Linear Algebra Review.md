There is also the **outer product** of vectors, where we take two vectors v<sub>0</sub> and v<sub>1</sub>, which both have dimensions n and m respectively, and we yield an n x m matrix.

ab^T = ma

**Similar Equation for a plane**
In 3D space, we can use vectors in the same way. ![[Pasted image 20250827122029.png]]
As an additional application of a dot product.
