The convolutional operation is given by:
$$H^{[filter]} = W^{[filter]} * X+b^{[filter]}$$
where 𝐗 is a matrix representing the pixels in a (height × 𝑤idth) arrangement.
In an image, this activation is a 2D object given by: $$A^{[filter]} = g(H^{[filter]})$$
and the resulting A is a feature map, one per filter.
