This is the *connectionist* tribe of machine learning, which includes the modern LLMs like GenAI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini). This is the main technique focused on modern research. 

The simplest form of a neural network is what we saw with linear regression where, we take a set of inputs `x1...xn` connected via weights to derive an output `yhat`. 
Recall the formulae:
