**What is Logging?**
- Take things that have occurred in a program and make a persistant copy of it to be checked at a later time. 

> Logging is the writing of program state information to some sort of store
- File
- Database 
- Allocated memory 
- Program events 
- Program status
- Errors 
- Warnings 
- End-user interactions 
Etc... 

**Why do we log?**
● Logging is used to record what occurred in  
our program  
● Without a log, it can be difficult or  
impossible to understand problems  
● A good log can make debugging customer  
issues much easier

Without knowing what happened, we cannot debug or audit our systems.
