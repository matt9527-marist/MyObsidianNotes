● How was it done in the old days?  
	– Phones  
	– Interoffice / postal mail  
● Long distance phone calls were expensive  
	– International calls even more so!  
● Phone call prices varied by time of day  
	– Local calls were flat rate  
	– Long distance was charged per minute  
	– Peak times were most expensive  
	– Cheapest calls were after work hours

**Issues with Phones**
● Before answering machines/voice mail  
● Lots of lost time trying to reach someone who is  
unavailable  
● If you stepped out, your secretary could take a message  
	– If you didn’t have a secretary, then callers could try the  
	switchboard  
	– Could possibly have you paged over the PA system  
	– Otherwise, you just didn’t get the message  
● Phones were tied to a desk, not a person

● How to get the word out?  
● Send a memo!  
● Typed output copied onto paper  
● Distributed by hand  
● Companies had mail rooms, just to keep the  
paper flowing  
● “Didn’t you get the memo?”

**Potential Problems**
This is how business operated for decades  
● Phones and typewriters were prevalent in  
business through the 20th century  
● The pace of business was just slower  
● If someone was out of the office, you waited  
for them to return

**Introduction of Email**
Electronic mail first appeared in the late 1960’s  
and 1970’s  
	– Customers of time-sharing systems and mainframes  
	were first users  
● What advantages did it bring to the table?  
	– Instantaneous communication  
	– Search / sort capabilities  
	– Easy to forward messages  
	– Message backup
Email is nice, but it isn't perfect. 
What are some problems with Email? 
- Spam / clutter
- Accidentally sending emails to the wrong person 
- Reply-all message wars 
- Adding a missing recipient to a message chain 
- Attachment sizes and backlevel versioning 

**Instant Messaging**
● Email is nice, but not real-time  
● Chat networks fill a communication niche  
● Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is the granddaddy  
of them all  
● Individual IM clients used to be popular in  
the past (AIM, ICQ, Jabber)

**Internet Relay Chat (IRC)**
● Open standard (RFC 1459)  
● Used by many open-source development projects  
● Lightweight and efficient, but not perfect  
● Any messages when logged out are missed!  
● Sometimes channels can be "taken over" and the  
admins kicked out  
● Very mature chat clients, available for almost any OS  
you can think of  
● Channels have "ops", (or operators) who exist to  
maintain order and discipline  
● Members who misbehave can be kicked, and/or  
banned.  
	– Kicks are temporary, and bans are permanent  
● Bot integration  
	– Can write programs that sit in a channel and perform  
	actions  
	– User recognition, permission handling (ops), help  
	requests, file transfers, announcements

**Slack**
● Based off IRC, but solves a lot of pain points  
● Slack is a free/paid service  
	– The free version is "good enough" for simple collaboration  
	– The paid version has lots of hooks into interesting widgets  
(Box, Trello, Github, etc)  
	– Keeps unlimited message history  
● File uploads / transfer  
● Requires trust on the part of the customer in Slack as  
a company  
● Looks much prettier than IRC  
	– Rich text formatting (bold, italic, code)  
● Clients available for Windows/Mac/Linux  
● Since it's proprietary, can offer unique add-ons, like video calls, and threaded discussions  
● Anyone can create a channel, and they can be public or private  
● There's lots of optional (paid) integration with corporate authentication systems (LDAP)  
● Bot integration

**Benefits of Chat Systems**
● Why use chat systems?  
● What benefits do they bring to the  
development process?  
● How do they compare with email, forums,  
wikis, etc?  
● Discuss scaling of communication

**Remote Work**
● Software development lends itself to  
remote work  
● What are some reasons to work remotely?
● Software development lends itself to remote  
work  
● What are some reasons to work remotely?  
	– Inclement weather  
	– Illness (self or family members)  
	– Travel (business or personal)  
	– Relocation  
	– (Inter)National teaming
