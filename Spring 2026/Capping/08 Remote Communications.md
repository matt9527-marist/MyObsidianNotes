● How was it done in the old days?  
	– Phones  
	– Interoffice / postal mail  
● Long distance phone calls were expensive  
	– International calls even more so!  
● Phone call prices varied by time of day  
	– Local calls were flat rate  
	– Long distance was charged per minute  
	– Peak times were most expensive  
	– Cheapest calls were after work hours

**Issues with Phones**
● Before answering machines/voice mail  
● Lots of lost time trying to reach someone who is  
unavailable  
● If you stepped out, your secretary could take a message  
	– If you didn’t have a secretary, then callers could try the  
	switchboard  
	– Could possibly have you paged over the PA system  
	– Otherwise, you just didn’t get the message  
● Phones were tied to a desk, not a person

● How to get the word out?  
● Send a memo!  
● Typed output copied onto paper  
● Distributed by hand  
● Companies had mail rooms, just to keep the  
paper flowing  
● “Didn’t you get the memo?”

**Potential Problems**
This is how business operated for decades  
● Phones and typewriters were prevalent in  
business through the 20th century  
● The pace of business was just slower  
● If someone was out of the office, you waited  
for them to return

**Introduction of Email**
Electronic mail first appeared in the late 1960’s  
and 1970’s  
	– Customers of time-sharing systems and mainframes  
	were first users  
● What advantages did it bring to the table?  
	– Instantaneous communication  
	– Search / sort capabilities  
	– Easy to forward messages  
	– Message backup
