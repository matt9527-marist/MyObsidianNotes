## System Concept Development 
Define the scope of the project. Includes the following:
- Systems Boundary Document: define the actual scope, fence in/out the problem. 
- Cost Benefit Analysis: Defines the programming time and financial cost. (Expenses vs. revenue)
- Risk Management Plan: How to figure out what risks might derail the project and how to prevent them
- Feasibility Study: Do we have enough people? Is the time realistic/visible? Does the technology allow this to be possible? Can it actually be done? 

## Cost Benefit Analysis? 
- Why are we going to do this project? 
- What do we hope to accomplish? 
	- Possible revenue opportunities? 
- What are the costs of doing so? 
	- Programmer expenses 
	- Benefits 
	- Cloud Renting 
- What are the benefits? 
	- Experience / networking / research skills 

## Risk Management Plan 
What are the risks?
- Lack of time / too difficult / lack of programming skills? / group infighting 
What if the project is not completed? 
- For us, delay of career plans 
How to mitigate the risk? 
 - Study material / meet deliverable deadlines 

## Feasibility Study 
The sponsor will do market research to figure out whether or not this project will succeed:
Might involve interviewing and consumer studies. 
- Forecasts possible revenue
- Helps senior management to determine if the project is a feasible decision. 
(Obviously, our mock project is forecast to succeed)

## Planning 
- Develop a project management plan and other planning docs 
- Provide the basis for acquiring the resources needed to achieve the solution 

## Requirements Analysis 
- Analyze user needs 
	- In our case we need a *performance monitoring application*
	- Create a **Functional Requirements Document**
		- Nail down what the requirements are. 
		- Dictated in this class, but still important 

## Design 
Transform detailed requirements into complete, detailed Systems Design Document 
- Create a *Design Document*
- Document how the software will be structured 
Focuses on how to deliver the required functionality
- It will break down the individual components and show how they connect to each other. 
- How are we actually going to implement what we want? 

## Development 
Take the design and turn it into real software. 
- Acquire and install the systems environment?
- Creating and testing databases 
- Preparing test cases 
- Preparing test files 
- Coding, compiling, and refining programs 
- Performing test readiness review 
- Procurement activities (hardware dongles, software rental, Azure servers)
(This is the coding part - static analysis, code reviews, and source code control)

## Integration and Test 
How do we make sure it is doing what we said it will do?
- Demonstrates the developed system conforms to requirements as specified in the Functional Requirements Document. 
- Test portion will require unit tests, as well as the ability to run a test suite to ensure correct functionality 
- We will be *graded on test coverage and how well the tests verify the correctness of the deliverable*.

## Implementation 
Designed, developed, tested, now get it to the production environment. 
- Resolution of problems identified in the Integration and Test phases. 

## Operations and Maintenance
How do we make sure that software is operating correctly after production? 
- Post-implementation and in-process reviews
- Fix future flaws, make patches/updates, and check security 
- Outside of our scope, but critical for real projects.
