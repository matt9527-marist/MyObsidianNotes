**Building Software**
● Transforming source code into executable code  
● Can be done on an ad-hoc basis via command-line  
statements  
	– Tends to be error-prone  
	– Leaves room for mistakes  
	– Easy to mess up command syntax with a stray character  
● Scripted build systems are better  
	– Reduces human involvement  
	– Can capture knowledge in the tool

**Build Scripts**
● Just a sequence of compiler commands  
● Can be a bash script or batch file  
● Very simple, to implement  
● Doesn't add much benefit to the process  
● Requires manual updating for almost any  
change
