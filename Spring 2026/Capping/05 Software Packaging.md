● A way to assemble a collection of software  
for distribution  
	– Distribution can be physical or electronic  
● Can be ad hoc, very formal, and everything  
in between

**History**
● Software originally didn’t need to be packaged  
● The physical medium was the package  
	– Floppy diskettes for PCs  
	– Magnetic tapes for mainframes  
● Just a collection of files, with perhaps a directory or  
two  
● No need for installation, as microcomputer disks  
were self-booting  
	– Insert disk, turn on power, and start using the software

● As PC’s added hard drives, rudimentary  
installers starting appearing  
	– Mostly for file copying  
	– Limited hardware selection (i.e. CGA / EGA /  
	VGA graphics)  
	– Sound card selection

**Growing Software**
● Software sizes began to expand past 1-2 floppy disks  
	– 5¼” disks held 360KB/1.2MB  
	– 3½” disks held 720KB/1.44MB (rarely 2.88MB)  
● Disk swapping works, but only up to a point  
	– PC’s never had more than 2 floppy drives  
● Compression software began to take root  
	– PKZIP was one of the most popular ones  
		● Created deflate algorithm (RFC 1951 )  
		● Could span floppy disks!  
	– Microsoft had it’s own format (DMF) for Windows 95  
		● It shipped on 13 floppies!  
	– Other compression formats abounded (ARJ, ACE, RAR, LZH, etc.)

**Executable Installers**
● MS Windows ushered in the era of graphical  
installers  
● PCs all had hard drives, and software was  
purchased in boxes from retail stores  
● Packaging was still rudimentary  
	– Just getting data from floppy or CD-ROM to hard  
drive  
● Windows 95 required uninstallers for the first time  
	– Necessary for logo compatibility
