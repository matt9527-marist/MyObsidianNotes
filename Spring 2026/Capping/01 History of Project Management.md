## Modern Business Environment 
Executives - responsible for the culture of the organization to accept project management and to ensure projects are successful. Determine strategy and future direction. 
High Speed - Products and services need to get to market faster than ever before; thus project  
management has to ensure the processes focus on value and strategic alignment to business goals.
Things can change in the market extremely quickly.
High Change - Businesses and political climate cause frequent changes that project management must accommodate and embrace. Change can also bring opportunity. 
Lower Cost - Focus on eliminating overhead activities which have little value 

Example: Apple iPod: Apple changed the personal music space because it created a need which replaced Sony with their Discman and Walkman devices. Sony has not reacted to the change and has never caught up in the music space. Certainly no one in the class would think of Sony as the industry leader. Competition does not wait. 
### 1945-1960
- Each line manager did their part; threw it over the fence. No single contact point for customers for questions. 
- Used in aerospace and defense industries. 
	- Projects had 200-300% overrun due to the inability of organizations to forecast technology. Technology was changing so fast that when an org was developing an airplane engine, for example, by the time they were 1/2 done, tech changed and forced the project to be reworked. 
- Focused on life-cycle planning, control model, and cost monitoring to ensure money was well-spent. 

### 1960-1985
– During this era organizations needed a way to adapt to change  
– Complexity of processes in a dynamic environment required project  
management  
– Informal project management  
	• *Project coordinators*: line management handled the project management  
	aspects  
– Formal project management  
	• Required when there are complex tasks, dynamic environment, limited  
	resources or tight schedules, interrelated activities, and dependencies on  
	multiple functional boundaries  
– Needed to use teams to tackle a solution and then terminate or  
disband the team  
– Project Managers became a single focal point

### 1985-today

• **Traditional Project Management**
	– Goal and solution are clear
• **Agile Project Management**
	– Goal is clear but solution is not
		• Where we will focus as a class
		• You will help define that solution using the techniques we
		learn each week.
• **Extreme Project Management**
	– Neither the goal or solution are clear
	– Mostly in the 90s, usually just trying to get somewhere with something 
• **Emertxe Project Management**
	– When the goal is not clear but the solution is
	– Not sure what we want, but we do know how to get there. 

> **Project** - temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. 

**Projects are like small businesses**
• Consumes Resources, such as:  
	– People  
	– Equipment  
	– Facilities  
• Accountable to Sponsors, who:  
	– Invest funds to underwrite the budget  
	– Define objectives  
	– Demand return on investment  
• Fulfills Financial Targets, such as:  
	– Conform to a budget  
	– Control costs  
	– Generate revenues and profit  
	– Maintain cash flow  
*• But:*  
	*– Unlike a small business, a project has a defined end point.*

**Project Management: Organization Competence**
• Why use Project Management?  
• Work is generally organized along project lines  
• **Project management provides a framework and**  
**consistent approach**  
	– Individuals involved in projects understand their roles  
	– Support to define project plan details  
	– Organizing the work to be implemented  
	– Evaluation of results  
• Project outcomes can be predicted with high degrees of  
certainty  
	– When predictions are incorrect, the organization has  
	the knowledge and ability to adjust decisions and take  
	proper corrective action early.
	– When done well, we can get accurate revenue forecasts. Stock of employers can either take a big hit or be very beneficial. 

> **Program** - group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually.

• A program may be an ongoing operation  
• For example:  
	– Software releases  
	– Newspaper editions  
	– Apple consumer products is a program (iPhone, iPad, AirPods,  
	etc.) thus Apple makes decisions as to which project should have  
	the investment. Why would Apple invest in iPad today vs. some  
	new technology?

## Focus of Project Management 
Managing the Triple Constraints of a Project  
	– Scope: the delivery requirements of the project  
	– Budget: the money allocated to the work of the project  
	– Schedule: the time to complete the project  
• These three attributes must be balanced, since changing one will affect the  
others  
	– Like a triangle, if you impact one side, it will impact the others  
	– A project will always have competing or conflicting demands  
• Focus on the Basics  
	– *Scope*  
		• Establishing clear and achievable goals  
		• Defining what’s in & what’s out  
		• Product Scope: what the project will deliver  
		• Project Scope: the work the project will undertake  
	• Responding to stakeholders’ concerns  
	– Budget: Managing contingencies  
	– Schedule: understand the critical path and its influence if changed
	- Beware of *scope creep* by placing a hardline on exactly what the project is going to achieve.
