## Biological Neuron vs. Artificial Network 
![[Pasted image 20260122190546.png]]
Simplest element of artifical neural network is the *artificial neuron*, mathematically represented as a signal (inputs) into a specific function generating an output. 

> Perceptron - mathematical model of neurons in our mind. The most basic element in deep artificial neural networks

AI is a large umbrella term. The hardware of AI includes machine learning, which is the "brain" that drives the AI. 
Deep Learning is a part of "representative learning" which attempts to learn from raw data. 

**Terminology**
AI definitions: (by the "fathers of AI")
1) John McCarthy: It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially *intelligent computer programs*. It is related to the similar task of *using computers to understand human intelligence*, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.
2) "Can machines think?" - defined by a question, offered by the famous *Turing Test*. 
	- Turing Test: 
3) We have 4 different definitions and goals for AI based on what we want to do:
	- Human Approach:
		- System that thinks like human 
		- System that acts like human 
	- Ideal approach: 
		- Systems that think rationally 
		- Systems that act rationally
