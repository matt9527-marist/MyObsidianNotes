Simplest element of artifical neural network is the *artificial neuron*, mathematically represented as a signal (inputs) into a specific function generating an output.

AI is a large umbrella term. The hardware of AI includes machine learning, which is the "brain" that drives the AI. 
Deep Learning is a part of "representative learning" which attempts to learn from raw data. 

**Terminology**
AI definitions: (by the "fathers of AI")
1) John McCarthy: It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially *intelligent computer programs*. It is related to the similar task of *using computers to understand human intelligence*, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.
2) "Can "
