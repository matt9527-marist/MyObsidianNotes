## Review 

**When might a deeper model generalize worse?**
- When we have a small amount of data, with many layers, we have many parameters. Do we have enough data to justify tuning all of these parameters? Without enough data, we will resort to memorization, rather than generalization. 
- The other condition is when we do not use the proper regularization.
